**Deeply watches your state-object and props** for changes. **Re-renders** automatically😎 and makes you write less code 😊.
- **Performance friendly**  
  React Deepwatch uses recursive [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to **watch only for those properties that are actually used** in your component function. It doesn't matter how complex and deep the graph behind your state or props is.
- **Can watch your -model- as well**  
  If a (used) property in props points to your model, a change there will also trigger a re-render. In fact, you can [watch anything](#usewatched) ;)

# Install
````bash
npm install --save react-deepwatch
````

# Usage
## no more setState
````jsx
import {WatchedComponent, useWatched, useWatchedState} from "react-deepwatch"
          
const MyComponent = WatchedComponent(props => {
    const state = useWatchedState({myDeep: {counter: 0, b: 2}}, {/* WatchedOptions (optional) */});

    return <div>
        Counter is: {state.myDeep.counter}
      <button onClick={ () => state.myDeep.counter++ /* will trigger a rerender */ }>Increase counter</button>
    </div>
}, {/* WatchedComponentOptions (optional) */});

<MyComponent/> // Use MyComponent
````

## and less... loading code
Now that we already have the ability to deeply record our reads, let's see if there's also a way to **cut away the boilerplate code for `useEffect`**.

````jsx
import {WatchedComponent, load} from "react-deepwatch"

const MyComponent = WatchedComponent(props => {

    return <div>
        Here's something fetched from the Server: { load(() => myFetchFromServer(props.myProperty), {/* LoadOptions (optional) */}) }
    </div>
});

<MyComponent/> // Use MyComponent
````
**`load(...)` re-executes `myFetchFromServer`, when a dependent value changes**. That means, it records all reads from previous code in your component function plus the reads immediately inside the `load(...)` call. _Here: props.myProperty._
The returned Promise will be await'ed and the component will be put into [suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) that long.  
_👍 load(...) can be inside a conditional block or a loop. Then it has already recorded the condition + everything else that leads to the computation of load(...)'s point in time and state 😎_

### Show a 🌀loading spinner
To show a 🌀loading spinner / placeholder during load, either...
 - wrap your component in a [`<Suspense fallback={<div>🌀</div>}>...<MyComponent/>...</Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It can be wrapped at any parent level😎.
 - or specify a `fallback` value via `load(..., {fallback:"🌀"})`, which is then used as a result for that **specific** statement (not the entire component).

### Handle errors
As with the above, you can **wrap your component in a** [`<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>...<MyComponent/>...</ErrorBoundary>`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) from the [react-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) package, to handle load errors. It can be wrapped at any parent level😎.  
It tries to recover from errors and re- runs the `loaderFn`, whenever a dependency changes. Note that recovering works only with the mentioned [react-error-boundary 4.x](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) and not with 3rd party error-boundary libraries.

### Performance optimization for load(...)
To reduce the number of expensive `myFetchFromServer` calls, try the following:
- Move the load(...) call as upwards in the code as possible, so it depends on fewer props / state / watched objects.
- See the `LoadOptions#fallback` and `LoadOptions#critical` settings. This can allow loading in parallel as well.

### Caveats
- The component function might return and empty `</>` on the first load and **produce a short screen flicker**. This is [because React's Suspense mechasim is not able to remeber state at that time](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#caveats). To circumvent this, specify `WatchedComponent#fallback`.
- `<Suspense>` and `<ErrorBoundary>` inside your component function do not handle/catch loads in that **same** function. _Means: You must place them outside to handle/catch them._
- When **try/catch' ing around `load(...)`** statements, you must check, if caught is `instanceof Promise` and re-throw it then. _Because this is the way for `load` to signal, that things are loading._
- SSR is not supported.
- [startTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) is not supported (has no effect).

#Further notes
### useWatched
You can also use `useWatched` similarly  to `useWatchedState` to watch any global object. _But in react paradigm, this is rather rare, because values are usually passed as props into your component function._
