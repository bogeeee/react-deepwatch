# React Deepwatch - no more setState and less


**Deeply watches your state-object and props** for changes. **Re-renders** automaticallyüòé and makes you write less code üòä.
- **Performance friendly**  
  React Deepwatch uses [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) facades to **watch only for those properties that are actually used** in your component function. It doesn't matter how complex and deep the graph behind your state or props is.
- **Can watch your -model- as well**  
  If a (used) property in props points to your model, a change there will also trigger a re-render. In fact, you can [watch anything](#watched) ;)

# Install
````bash
npm install --save react-deepwatch
````

# Usage
## no more setState
````jsx
import {watchedComponent, watched, useWatchedState} from "react-deepwatch"
          
const MyComponent = watchedComponent(props => {
    const state = useWatchedState( {myDeep: {counter: 0, b: 2}}, {/* WatchedOptions (optional) */} );

    return <div>
        Counter is: {state.myDeep.counter}
      <button onClick={ () => state.myDeep.counter++ /* will trigger a rerender */ }>Increase counter</button>
    </div>
}, {/* WatchedComponentOptions (optional) */});

<MyComponent/> // Use MyComponent
````

## and less... loading code
Now that we already have the ability to deeply record our reads, let's see if there's also a way to **cut away the boilerplate code for `useEffect`**.

````jsx
import {watchedComponent, load, poll, isLoading, loadFailed, preserve} from "react-deepwatch"

const MyComponent = watchedComponent(props => {

    return <div>
        Here's something fetched from the Server: {  load( async () => await myFetchFromServer(props.myProperty), {/* LoadOptions (optional) */} )  }
    </div>
});

<MyComponent/> // Use MyComponent
````
**`load(...)` re-executes `myFetchFromServer`, when a dependent value changes**. That means, it records all reads from previous code in your component function plus the reads immediately inside the `load(...)` call. _Here: props.myProperty._
The returned Promise will be await'ed and the component will be put into [suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) that long.  
üëç load(...) can be inside a conditional block or a loop. Then it has already recorded the condition + everything else that leads to the computation of load(...)'s point in time and state üòé._
For this mechanic to work, **make sure, all sources are watched**: `props` and `load(...)`'s result are already automatically watched; For state, use `useWatchedState(...)`; For context, use  `watched(useContext(...))`.

### Show a üåÄloading spinner
To show a üåÄloading spinner / placeholder during load, either...
 - **wrap your component in a [`<Suspense fallback={<div>üåÄ</div>}>...<MyComponent/>...</Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)**. It can be wrapped at any parent levelüòé. _Or..._
 - **call isLoading()** inside your component, to probe if any or a certain `load(...)`statement is loading. _See jsDoc for usage example. Mind the caveat of not using it for a condition to cut off a load statement._ _and/or..._   
 - **specify a fallback** value via `load(..., {fallback:"üåÄ"})`.

### Handle errors
either...
 - **wrap your component in a** [`<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>...<MyComponent/>...</ErrorBoundary>`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) from the [react-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) package. It can be wrapped at any parent levelüòé.  
   It tries to recover from errors and re- runs the `loaderFn`, whenever a dependency changes. Note that recovering works only with the mentioned [react-error-boundary 4.x](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) and not with 3rd party error-boundary libraries. _Or..._
 - **try/catch around the load(...)** statement. Caveat: You must check, if caught is `instanceof Promise` and re-throw it then. _Because this is the way for `load` to signal, that things are loading._ _Or..._
 - **call** the **loadFailed()** probing function. This looks more elegant than the above. _See jsDoc for usage example._

### Performance optimization for load(...)
To reduce the number of expensive `myFetchFromServer` calls, try the following:
- Move the load(...) call as upwards in the code as possible, so it depends on fewer props / state / watched objects.
- See the `LoadOptions#fallback`, `LoadOptions#silent` and `LoadOptions#critical` settings.
- Use the `preserve` function on all your fetched data, to smartly ensure non-changing object instances in your app (`newFetchResult` **===** `oldFetchResult`; Triple-equals. Also for the deep result_). Changed object instances can either cascade to a lot of re-loads or result in your component still watching the old instance.
  _Think of it like: The preserve function does for your data, what React does for your component tree: It smartly remembers the instances, if needed with the help of an id or key, and re-applies the re-fetched/re-rendered properties to them, so the object-identity/component-state stays the same._  
  üëç `load(...)` does call `preserve` by default to enforce this paradigm and give you the best, trouble free experience.

### Caveats
- The component function might return and empty `</>` on the first load and **produce a short screen flicker**. This is [because React's Suspense mechasim is not able to remeber state at that time](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#caveats). To circumvent this, specify `WatchedComponentOptions#fallback`.
- `<Suspense>` and `<ErrorBoundary>` inside your component function do not handle/catch loads in that **same** function. _Means: You must place them outside to handle/catch them._
- If your app is a mixed scenario with non-watchedComponents and relies on the old way of fully re-rendering the whole tree to pass deep model data (=more than using shallow, primitive props) to the leaves, mind disabling the WatchedComponentOptions#memo flag.
- SSR is not supported.
- [startTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) is not supported (has no effect).
- As said: Keep in mind that `load(...)` calls `preserve` on its result. It also invalidates (destroys) the "unused" objects. _When they're not really unused any you are trying to access them, You'll get the proper error message how to disable it_.

# Further notes

### watched
You can also use `watched` similarly  to `useWatchedState` to watch any global object. _But in React paradigm, this is rather rare, because values are usually passed as props into your component function._

### poll
Besides `load`, there's also the `poll` function, which works similar, but re-loads in regular intervals. _See jsDoc_

### Simplify the server side as well
If you like, how this library simplifies things for you and want to write the backend (http) endpoints behind your load(...) statements simply as typescript methods, have a look at my flagship project [Restfuncs](https://github.com/bogeeee/restfuncs).
Example: 
````typescript
// In your watchedComponent function:
return <div>The greeting's result from server is: {  load( async () => await myRemoteSession.greet(state.name) )  }</div>

// On the server:
...
@remote greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello ${name}` 
}
...
````
_The example leaves away all the the setup-once boilerplate code.  
Also in your tsx, you can enjoy type awareness / type safety and IDE's code completion around `myRemoteSession.greet` and all its parameters and returned types, which is a feature that only rpc libraries can offer (Restfuncs is such one)üòé_
